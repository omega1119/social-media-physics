# Social Media Physics

## Overview
This project introduces a physics-based approach to analyzing social media content virality. Inspired by Newton's Second Law of Motion, we define the force of social media content as:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

where:
- $ F $ represents the "social media force" (content impact).
- $ m $ is the "mass" of the content, representing a relative weighting of different media types based on shareability.
- $ a $ is "acceleration," defined as the second derivative of views with respect to time (views per second squared).

By assigning different weights to media types and modeling acceleration using a Gaussian function, we simulate and analyze content impact over time.

## Features
- **Mathematical Model**: Defines a structured way to quantify social media impact.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: Includes a simulation script in `notebook.ipynb` using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Plots force over time for different media types.
- **Potential for Real Data Analysis**: Can be extended to analyze YouTube and other social media datasets.

## Installation
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells to generate force-over-time graphs for different content types:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

## Future Work
- **Integration with Real Data**: Use YouTube API to fetch video performance statistics.
- **Refining Mass Values**: Use empirical data to adjust content weighting factors.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Develop tools to predict viral potential of content.
